# SwiftMind
This is an Android app for improving your mood by tracking it daily and resource suggestions. This is an app that strives to promote the necessity of good mental health in any individual’s life. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood and ageing. Swift Mind is a personal journal to track one’s mental health concerns and provide useful insights and resources. Built with the prime intent to help discard the taboo around this subject, this app also helps connect with the necessary specialised field personnel when professional help is needed.

The above-shown layout is a basic idea of the application design. The app starts with the welcome page i.e. the parallax page displayed when a user opens the application. If the user is opening the app for the first time, it will also provide a quick tour of what exactly the application provides. The app takes input from the user about the emotion felt that particular day and keeps a record of it. It also enables the user to maintain a virtual journal to completely express themselves for better self-introspection and much more.
Furthermore, the application also has a detailed graph of the user’s mental health entries to give a better view of their moods, issues, etc. There is also a browse tab meant to help read more from the wide range of articles on mental health, positivity and much more around those themes to help the user uplift their mood and also gain more information about mental health. Finally, the app also has a settings tab for the user to modify their preferences.

This project has successfully attempted to bridge the gap between self-doubt and self-introspection. Through Swift Mind, we wanted to help reduce the stigma around the world of mental health. With advanced technical knowledge, this attempt was a success and we hope to keep developing and upgrading it further for the betterment of the people around us.
While developing this project we have learnt a lot about basic concepts of androidphonefeatures and capabilities. We understood the basic technologies used by the Android platform, the relationship between XML and Java for the Android platform, the uses of AndroidManifest.xml, Strings.xml, drawable folder, etc.
We have learned through our project that Android is a much more diverse operating system than iOS and Windows Phone Mobile. There are still challenges that could be out of the box, but we have tried our best to cover multiple scenarios and possibilities that might be encountered and are looking forward to bringing in a better version of the application with newer updates in the near future.
